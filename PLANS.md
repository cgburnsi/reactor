# PLANS.md

## Purpose
Defines how substantial changes are planned and executed in this repository.

## When to use an ExecPlan
Use an ExecPlan when work is algorithmic, cross-cutting, or likely to take more than one focused coding session.

## Canonical template
- Primary template: `docs/exec-plans/TEMPLATE.md`
- Active plans: `docs/exec-plans/active/`
- Completed plans: `docs/exec-plans/completed/`

## Required workflow
1. Fill Sections 1-4 before coding.
2. Implement using vertical slices.
3. Update Progress, Surprises, and Decision Log during execution.
4. Record validation evidence before marking complete.

## Alignment with repository docs
- Policies and milestone order: `AGENTS.md`
- Stable technical boundaries: `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Execution details and progress: `docs/exec-plans/*`
